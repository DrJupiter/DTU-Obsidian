## How to design

- Easy to determine possible actions
- Visible conceptual model of the system
>	Means that the user should be able to comprehend what they are seeing and how it works
- The user can evaluate the current state of the system
> They need to understand what's going on.
- Natural mapping between:
- - Intentions and required actions
- - Action and effect
- - Good visible information of the system state

## 8 golden design rules

- Consistency and self containment
- Cater to new and experienced users
- Informative feedback
- Closure when you finish a sequence and transition into new ones
- Prevent user erros and help them undo them (2)
- Make the user feel like they're in control
- Reduce complexity and memory overload (ik' t√¶nk)
