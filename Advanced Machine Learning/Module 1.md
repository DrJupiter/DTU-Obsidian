### Generative models

Here is a comparison of the following

#### Autoregressive models (Future independent models)

#### Flow-based models (Transformed probability models)

In our case, we will use a an invertible transformation, such that there exists a homomorphism 
and then we have the distribution over x as

#### Latent variable models

Any model where we sample, x, from a latent space.

See here for more detail [[Latent variable models]]

#### Energy based models

We apply exp^{-1} to some function.
