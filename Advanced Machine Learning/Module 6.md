## Addition and Subtraction over our embeddings

![[Pasted image 20240314131205.png]]

We have displacement vectors and point vectors.

Displacement vectors are type T, and point vectors are type M.

Our riemann abstraction leads us to T being a velocity of a curve that is the shortest path between two points.
> For historical reasons this subtraction map is called a logarithmic map

addition is done by the exponential map

U,V are orthogonal, so they are volume perserving, which is why we disregard them.

#### A distance measure independent of parameterization for pd's

Infinitesimal local KL

We view F as a riemann metric, the Fisher-Rao metric.

Here the energy is the distance measure??
